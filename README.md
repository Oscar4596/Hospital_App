### Getting Started

> If you're only developing for one platform you can ignore the steps below that are tagged with the platform you don't require.

#### 1) Clone & Install Dependencies

- 1.1) `git clone https://github.com/Oscar4596/Hospital_App.git`
- 1.2) `cd Hospital_App` - cd into your newly created project directory.
- 1.3) Install NPM packages with your package manager of choice - i.e run `yarn` or `npm install`
- 1.4) **[iOS]** `cd ios` and run `pod install` - if you don't have CocoaPods you can follow [these instructions](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started) to install it.
- 1.5) **[Android]** No additional steps for android here.

#### 2) Rename Project

**You will need to be running Node verison 7.6 or greater for the rename functionality to work**

- 2.0) **[iOS]** `cd ..` to return to the root directory of the project
- 2.1) `npm run rename` - you'll be prompted to enter a project name and company name
- 2.2) Note down the package name value - you'll need this when setting up your Firebase project

#### 3) Add `Google Services` files (plist & JSON)

- 3.1) **[iOS]** Follow the `add firebase to your app` instructions [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup#add_firebase_to_your_app) to generate your `GoogleService-Info.plist` file if you haven't done so already - use the package name generated previously as your `iOS bundle ID`.
- 3.2) **[iOS]** Place this file in the `ios/` directory of your project.
- 3.3) **[Android]** Follow the `manually add firebase` to your app instructions [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup#manually_add_firebase) to generate your `google-services.json` file if you haven't done so already - use the package name generated previously as your `Android package name`.
- 3.4) **[Android]** Place this file in the `android/app/` directory of your project.
  
#### 4) Start your app

- 4.0) First of all, make sure that you have installed th android SDK, the easiest way is installing android studio and managing the packages from there. Also, make sure of having the different versions of sdk that your app needs.
- 4.1) Start the react native packager, run `yarn run start` or `npm start` from the root of your project.
- 4.2) **[iOS]** Build and run the iOS app, run `npm run ios` or `yarn run ios` from the root of your project. The first build will take some time. This will automatically start up a simulator also for you on a successful build if one wasn't already started.
- 4.3) **[Android]** If you haven't already got an android device attached/emulator running then you'll need to get one running (make sure the emulator is with Google Play / APIs). When ready run `npm run android` or `yarn run android` from the root of your project.

#### 5) Install React Navigation in order to use the navigation feature.

- 5.1) With `npm`install React Navigation running `npm install --save react-navigation`
- 5.2) Just in case, install react native gesture handler running the following on the command line:
`npm install --save react-native-gesture-handler`
- 5.3) Now, link all the native dependencies with
`react-native link react-native-gesture-handler`

#### 6) Useful commands!

- 6.1) `adb shell input text "RR"` Recarga la aplicación desde el command line sin la necesidad de hacerlo desde el dispositivo
- 6.2) `react-native log-android` Muestra logs de la app en consola
- 6.3) `adb devices` Inicia el daemon de adb para ver dispositivos conectados y los lista.
